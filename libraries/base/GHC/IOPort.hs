{- ^
An 'IOPort' is a synchronising variable, used
for communication between concurrent threads, where it one of the threads is
controlled by an external state. e.g. by an I/O action that is serviced by the
runtime.  It can be thought of as a box, which may be empty or full.

It is mostly similar to the behavior of MVar except writeIOPort doesn't block if
the variable is full and the GC won't forcibly release the lock if it thinks
there's a deadlock.

{-
M-Vars are rendezvous points for concurrent threads.  They begin
empty, and any attempt to read an empty M-Var blocks.  When an M-Var
is written, a single blocked thread may be freed.  Reading an M-Var
toggles its state from full back to empty.  Therefore, any value
written to an M-Var may only be read once.  Multiple reads and writes
are allowed, but there must be at least one read between any two
writes.
